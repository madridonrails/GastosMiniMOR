Ruby
----
This application was developed with Ruby 1.8.4 and Ruby 1.8.5.

Before compiling Ruby from sources be sure that the zlib dev files are installed,
you can test whether zlib support is compiled running

  ruby -rzlib -e1

If you get a silent prompt back it is installed, otherwise you see an error.

The readline library should be available as well, otherwise script/console won't work.

Rails comes bundled
-------------------
Rails 1.2.3 comes bundled under vendor, no need to install it separately.
Don't worry if there's a system-wide Rails, if so it is ignored.
